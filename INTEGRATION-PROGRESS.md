# ✅ Integration Progress

## Phase 1: Landlord-Tenant Chapter ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** Successfully integrated into `guides.tsx`  
**Build:** ✅ Passing  
**Bundle Size:** 123.73 kB (increased from 105KB)

### What Was Added:
- Chapter 8: MA Landlord-Tenant Law
- 6 sections with comprehensive content
- 310 lines of material
- Security deposits, leases, eviction, tenant rights

---

## Phase 2: Zoning Chapter 🚧 IN PROGRESS

Due to file size limitations, I'll create the zoning chapter content in a simplified integration file for you to manually add.

**Next step:** Manually copy the zoning content from `NEW-CONTENT-ZONING.tsx` lines 4-351 and paste after the Landlord-Tenant chapter in `guides.tsx`, before the closing `];`

## ✅ What's Working Now

Your app now has:
1. ✅ All original content
2. ✅ MA Landlord-Tenant Law chapter (NEW!)
3. 🔜 Zoning chapter (ready to add)

**Build status:** Success with no errors!
